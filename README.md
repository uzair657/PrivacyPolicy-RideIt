# PrivacyPolicy-RideIt
RideIt Application Privacy Policy

Welcome to RideIt. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy describes our privacy practices, the personal information we collect, how we use and share it, as well as your choices and rights regarding this information.   

This Privacy Policy applies to our Services wherever we provide them, and we will comply with local laws in relation to all practices described in this policy.  If there is an inconsistency between this policy and the local law, we will comply with the local law to the extent of the inconsistency.

RideIt is provided and controlled by the entity indicated in the Terms of Use applicable to your country of residence (“we” or “us”). 

This policy applies to all RideIt users, including users of our, RideIt , RideIt Driver mobile applications (“Apps”), and any services we provide through the Apps, as well as when you contact us via telephone, email, written correspondence, social media, in-person, or any other means of contact (collectively, “Services”). This policy does not cover how we handle information that we collect about our employees or business associates, including our corporate partners, vendors, and subcontractors, but does apply to our Drivers.

In this policy individuals who utilize our Services are referred to as “Users.” Users that request or receive transportation are referred to as “Riders” and individuals who provide transportation to Riders are referred to as “Drivers.” Capitalized terms that are not defined in this policy have the meaning given to them in the Terms of Use.  If you accept the Terms of Use you agree to us dealing with your information in the way described in this policy.

 

What information we collect

We collect three categories of information about you: information you provide, information we collect automatically, and information we obtain from other sources.

We do not collect or process information about your racial or ethnic origin, political opinions or membership of any political association, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade-union membership, genetic data, biometric data, or data concerning a person’s sex life.
 

Information you provide

Registration and profile information, such as your name, phone number, email,  profile picture. Where permitted or required by law, we may collect emergency contact numbers.

Driver’s information, which may include driver’s license data and status, information about the vehicle (type, make, model, year of manufacture, color, registration certificate data, license plate, vehicle inspection report, vehicle photo), ID document data (including driver license, passport, state identification numbers), proof of identity, proof of residency, physical address, date of birth, taxation identifier number, relevant insurance, right to work, driving record, payment or banking information, and other documents which may be required by applicable regulations. Where permitted or required by law, we may conduct identity verification and/or background check. This may require collecting and processing such information as your photograph, ID document data, social security number and criminal record. This information may be processed by vendors on our behalf.

User generated content that you choose to upload through the Services, such as comments, ratings, and reviews for other Users.

Information in correspondence you send to us, which may include chat messages, emails, and recordings of phone calls you make to us.
 

Information we collect automatically

Location information. We collect Users’ location data to enable rides, for user support, for safety and fraud detection purposes, and to satisfy legal requirements. We collect location information (including GPS coordinates and WiFi data) based on your App settings, device permissions, and whether you are using the App as a Rider or a Driver (where applicable):

-  Riders: We collect your device’s precise location when the App is running in the foreground (App open and on-screen) and when the App is running in the background (App open but not on-screen) from the time you request a ride until it ends. Riders may use the App without enabling it to collect precise location data from their mobile devices by directly inputting your pick-up and drop-off address or coordinates into the App. This may affect the availability of App features.

-  Drivers: We collect your device’s precise location when the App is running in the foreground (App open and on-screen) and when the App is running in the background (App open but not on-screen) in the Driver mode. We may also collect precise location for a limited time after you exit Driver mode in order to detect and investigate ride incidents.

Transaction information. We collect transaction information related to the use of our Services, including the type of Services requested or provided, order details, payment transaction information, date and time the service was provided, amount charged, route and distance traveled, and payment method.

Usage information. We collect data about your use of our Services. This may include such data as access dates and times, App features or pages viewed, App or Website crashes and other system activity. We may also collect and use for marketing purposes the data related to third-party sites you have visited or services you used before interacting with our Services.
 

Information we obtain from other sources

Third-party services. We may receive the information about Users from our service providers, which include background check and identity verification providers, insurance partners, financial services vendors and marketing providers. If you choose to use a third-party communication application (such as WhatsApp) or, sign up using a third-party social network or login service (such as Facebook), where this functionality is available, we may collect information from these services. Please, refer to the third-parties' privacy policies to find out how they treat your information.

State authorities. We may receive information about Users from law enforcement agencies and other government authorities as part of a law enforcement request, during legal proceedings, or as required or authorized by law.

Other Users or third parties. Sometimes Users or others may provide us with information about you, including through user support, or in connection with claims or disputes.  We will only keep and use this information if we could have lawfully collected it from you.

Sharing location information. Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect or how we can use that information. For example, you can prevent your device from sharing location information through your device’s system settings. This will, however, impact our ability to provide you with the full range of Services.

Unsubscribing from marketing emails and SMS messages. You can opt out of marketing emails and SMS messages by using the “unsubscribe” link or mechanism noted in such emails and SMS messages.

You can delete your account through the App settings or request the deletion of your account or your data by contacting user support at rideitofficial.pk@gmail.com You may be asked to verify your account and identity.

The retention periods will be different depending on the type of information, the category of User to whom the information relates, and the purposes for which we use it.
